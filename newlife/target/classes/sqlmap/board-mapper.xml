<!-- namespace는 BoardMapper 인터페이스의 위치 -->
<!-- 왜냐면 이 xml파일은 해당 interface를 통해 mapping을 설정해주는 것이기에 -->
<!-- Namespaces were optional in previous versions of MyBatis, which was 
	confusing and unhelpful. Namespaces are now required and have a purpose beyond 
	simply isolating statements with longer, fully-qualified names. Namespaces 
	enable the interface bindings as you see here, and even if you don’t think 
	you’ll use them today, you should follow these practices laid out here in 
	case you change your mind. Using the namespace once, and putting it in a 
	proper Java package namespace will clean up your code and improve the usability 
	of MyBatis in the long term. : MyBatis3 공식 설명 -->
